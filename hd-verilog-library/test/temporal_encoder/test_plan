Temporal encoder test plan:

1) mode predict
	- put it into mode_predict
	- give it a series of randomly generated spatial vectors
	- after 3 vectors have been input, start checking outputs
	- do so for N cycles

2) mode train
	- put it into mode_train
	- give it a series of randomly generated spatial vectors
	- after a random number of spatial vectors (between 3 and MAX_BUNDLE_CYCLES), change to mode_predict and check for outputs
	- loop for N cycles, with different labels each time

3) mode train with new label
	- put it into mode_train
	- give it a series of randomly generated spatial vectors
	- after a random number of spatial vectors (between 3 and MAX_BUNDLE_CYCLES), change input label and check for outputs
	- loop for N cycles, with different labels each time

4) switch modes
	- put into mode_predict
	- give it a series of randomly generated spatial vectors
	- after 3 vectors have been input, start checking outputs, which can be precomputed
	- put into mode_train
	- after a random number of spatial vectors (between 3 and MAX_BUNDLE_CYCLES), change input label and check for outputs
	- put into mode_predict
	- check outputs
